# Trillo

This is a site built to experiment with FlexboxðŸ“¦ .

This a simple landing page of an all in one booking app by fictional company called Trillo.

This project contains only the landing page with a search bar, sidebar, main section with testmonials and offer and finally a footer. Note that all of these features have no real functionality other than animations, the goal in this project was to simply play around with Flexbox.

The layout used is, of course, Flexbox.
